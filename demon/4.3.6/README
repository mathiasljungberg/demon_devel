 
- distchk.f: distance check disabled to be able to read in two structures outside of simulation mode
- wfovlap_nohole.f: this calculates determinantal overlaps between two determinantal wave functions, without assuming any holes
- wfovlap_gs_single_exc.f: here we compute the overlaps of singly excited states form a reference determinant
- compress_gs_single_exc.f: creates an excited state determinant by switching indices of an occupied and an unoccupied state
